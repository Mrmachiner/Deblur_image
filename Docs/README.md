# What is this repo ?

This repository is a Keras implementation of [Deblur GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07064.pdf). You can find a tutorial on how it works on [Medium](https://blog.sicara.com/keras-generative-adversarial-networks-image-deblurring-45e3ab6977b5). Below is a sample result (from left to right: sharp image, blurred image, deblurred image)
